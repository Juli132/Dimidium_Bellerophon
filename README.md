# Bellerophon – A Compiled DSL for 3D Printer Macros

Bellerophon is a compiled domain-specific language (DSL) and IDE designed to replace rigid G-code scripts with structured, parametric macros. By acting as a universal abstraction layer, it allows you to write complex procedural geometry and machine control logic once, and compile it directly into target-specific formats like Klipper and Marlin.

Built entirely as a local-first, cloud-free toolchain, the overarching Dimidium Ecosystem provides a complete end-to-end manufacturing pipeline:

Bellerophon IDE: A real-time syntax-validating editor for authoring multi-firmware macros.

CFG Generator & Boundary Checker: A visual configuration app that validates hardware pins and simulates G-code paths to prevent physical bed crashes.

Gravity Hub (Beta): A dynamic fleet deployment layer for managing and syncing compiled scripts across local network printers.

Note: The server runs locally on port 4567. No internet connection required after installation.

## Program Structure


A Bellerophon program consists of one or more macros. Each macro starts with M.title and ends with M.end.

    M.title "Macro Name"
        [statement 1]
        [statement 2]
        [statement 3]
    M.end

- Each command must be on its own line.
- Indentation is optional but recommended.
- Comments start with #.

### Example – a simple move

    M.title "move_left"
    Relative
    MoveTo x = -5
    Absolute
    M.end

## Capabilities

- Klipper: support for most Bellerophon features, including if statements, advanced temperature commands, and Klipper-specific G-code macros.
-Marlin: Simpler output that omits features not available in Marlin firmware. Conditional statements (if/endif) are not supported in Marlin mode; however, all other movement, heating, looping, and macro commands work as expected (loops are automatically expanded at compile time).

- Bellerophon accepts only .bph source files.
- The IDE provides real-time syntax validation, highlighting errors as you type.
-Line-Oriented Parsing: In the current build, the compiler utilizes strict line-by-line parsing. Each command must exist on a continuous, contiguous line without empty line breaks separating execution statements.
- Supported commands include: movement, temperature control, heaters, fans, waits, pauses, macro calls, repeat loops, Brepeat loops, conditional execution (Klipper only), extruder control, and bed/probe operations.

- Compiles .bph scripts into either Klipper macro .cfg files or Marlin .gcode files.
- Compiled macros can be deployed via Gravity Hub or directly from Mainsail (Klipper) or any Marlin host.
- The IDE provides Build Log and Exceptions tabs for debugging compilation errors.

- Arithmetic expressions in coordinates and parameters – globally available.
- Mathematical functions: sin, cos, tan, sqrt, abs, sign, power operator ^, and constant pi.
- Parametric loops using repeat (static repetition) and Brepeat (dynamic, iteration-aware), including nested loops and iterator-based expressions.
- Parametric Geometry – generate circles, spirals, or arbitrary curves.
- Conditional execution with if (Klipper only).
- Temperature management for extruder, bed, and chamber (Set_Heater_Temperature, Heat, WaitForTemp).
- Movement commands: absolute/relative positioning, X/Y/Z moves, extruder control, dwell/wait.
- Macro calls within macros (M.call).
- Bed and probe management: BED_MESH_CALIBRATE, PROBE_CALIBRATE, LoadBedMesh.
- Fan control, pressure advance, speed settings, idle timeout (TIMEOUT_SET).
- Pause, resume, cooldown, SD card file printing (PRINTFILE).

- IDE Reference Panel – displays all Bellerophon tokens. Users can pin commands to a sidebar for quick access while typing.
- Session Restoration – the IDE automatically restores the previous editing session to prevent accidental data loss.
- Dimidium Ecosystem Integration (Beta/Roadmap): Compiled macros are designed to be deployed and managed across a dynamic fleet via Gravity Hub (currently in active pipeline development).
- Printer Profile UI: The IDE provides a graphical interface to set hardware limits and default printing parameters (nozzle diameter, filament
diameter, layer height, extrusion multiplier). These settings are used as defaults unless overridden by macro commands.
- Local user variables – define and reuse variables inside macros.
- Hardware Configuration: Includes a built-in CFG Generator and visual Boundary Checker web app to generate foundational machine configurations and simulate G-code paths against physical bed dimensions to prevent mechanical crashes.
